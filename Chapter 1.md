### Exercise 1
The identity $(1+x)\sum_{k = 0}^{n}{(-x)^n} = 1 \pm x^{n+1}$ gives an inverse for $n$ large enough. If $a$ is a unit, $a^{-1}x$ is still nilpotent. We just showed that $1+a^{-1}x$ must be a unit, and it follows $a + x$ is a unit. 

### Exercise 2
i) Suppose $f = a_0 + a_1x + \ldots + a_nx^n$ is invertible and nonconstant and let $g = b_0 + b_1x + \ldots + b_mx^m$ be an inverse of $f$, i.e $fg = 1$. 
That means in particular $f(0)g(0) = a_0g(0) = 1$ and $a_0$ is a unit. 
We clearly have $a_n b_m = 0$. 
We also have $a_nb_{m-1} + a_{n-1}b_m = 0$ so  $a_n^2b_{m-1} + a_{n-1}a_nb_m = a_n^2 b_{m-1} = 0$.
Iterating this process we get $a_n^{r+1} b_{m-r} = 0$.
Setting for $r = m$ gives $a_n^{m+1} = 0$ as $b_0$ is a unit. 

Exercise $1$ gives the other implication.

ii) If all the $a_i$ are nilpotent, $f$ is a sum of nilpotents, so it is itself nilpotent.

In the other direction, since $f$ is nilpotent,$\frac{f(x) - f(0)}{x}$ is also nilpotent, because sum of nilpotents is nilpotent and $x$ is regular in $A[x]$. Iterating, we get the result.

iii) Pick $g$ of minimal degree such that $fg = 0$. Since $a_nb_m = 0$, $\deg a_ng < \deg g$ and $a_ngf = 0$ so $a_ng = 0$ by minimality. It follows that $f - a_nx^n$ is still annihilated by $g$, and thus $a_{n-1}b_m = 0$, and then by the same argument $a_{n-1}g = 0$. Iterating, we get $a_kg = 0$ for $0 \leq k \leq n$. This means that $b_m \cdot f = 0$.

iv) Let's denote by $(f)$ the ideal generated by the coefficients of $f$, by abuse of notation. We clearly have $(fg) \subset (f)$ and $(fg) \subset (g)$, which implies that if $fg$ is primitive, $f$ and $g$ are. 
Let's now suppose $f, g$ are primitive and $fg$ is not, and let $I$ be a prime ideal containing $(fg)$. Clearly, $f$ and $g$ are not zero mod $I$, otherwise $1$ would be zero mod $I$, but $fg$ is, contradicting that $I$ is prime.

### Exercise 3
Induction (too lazy to do it properly)

### Exercise 4
Let $f$ be in the Jacobson radical. We will show $f$ is nilpotent. For any $g \in A[X]$, $1 - gf$ is a unit. Setting $g = x$, we get that $1 - xf$ is a unit. By exercise 2, this mean all of the coefficients of $f$ are nilpotent, that is, $f$ is nilpotent.

### Exercise 5
i) If $f$ is a unit, with inverse $g$, $f(0)g(0) = 1$ and $a_0$ is a unit.

In the other direction, assuming $a_0$ is a unit we construct the coefficients $(b_n)$ of an inverse $g = \sum_n b_nx^n$ inductively. Set $b_0 = \frac{1}{a_0}$. Assuming $b_0, \ldots, b_n$ are already defined, let $b_{n+
1} = -a_0^{-1}(b_na_1 + \ldots + b_0a_{n+1})$. It is now routine to check that $fg = 1$

ii) We argue similarly to exercise 2. If $f$ is nilpotent, $f(0)$ is nilpotent, and then $f - f(0)$ is nilpotent and finally $\frac{f-f(0)}{x}$ is nilpotent.

As for the converse, let $A = \bigoplus_{n = 1}^\infty \mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$ and let $a_n = (p \delta_{i, n})_{i \in \mathbb{N}^*}$. Clearly, each $a_n$ is nilpotent. The $n$th coefficient of $f^k$ is $[n]f^k = \displaystyle\sum_{i_1 + \ldots + i_k = n}{a_{i_1} \ldots a_{i_k}}$. For it to be zero, we must have in particular that the nth coordinate (of the nth coefficient...) is zero. It is equal to $kp$, since any term containing $a_n$ as a factor must have the $k$th other factor to be $a_0$, and there is then $k$ choice for the position of the $a_n$ coefficient. For $n$ large enough, $kp \neq 0 \pmod p^n$, and thus $f^k \neq 0$. 

iii) If $f$ is in the Jacobson radical of $A[[X]]$, then for any constant $b$, $1 - fb$ is a unit and thus $1-f(0)b$ is a unit, meaning $a_0$ is in the Jacobson radical of $A$. 

We showed in i) that $1-fg$ is a unit iff $1-f(0)g(0)$ is a unit. If $f(0)$ is in the Jacobson radical, then $1-f(0)g(0)$ is always invertible and we're done.

iv) Let $\pi: A[[X]] \to A$ be the quotient map and $\mathfrak{m}$ be a maximal ideal of $A[[X]]$. As $\pi$ is surjective, $\mathfrak{m}^c = \pi(\mathfrak{m})$ is an ideal, and the image of a maximal ideal is maximal.
We clearly have $\mathfrak{m} \subset (\mathfrak{m}^c, x)$, and since $(\mathfrak{m}^c, x) \subsetneq A[[X]$, maximality gives $\mathfrak{m} = (\mathfrak{m}^c, x)$. 

v) Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal of $A$. Then $I = (\mathfrak{p}, x)$ is a prime ideal of $A[[X]]$, with contraction $\mathfrak{p}$. Indeed, $A[[X]]/\mathfrak{p} \simeq A/\mathfrak{p}$. 

### Exercise 6
Assume $\mathfrak{n} \subsetneq \mathfrak{r}$. Then there is some idempotent $e \in \mathfrak{r}$, meaning that $1-e$ is both invertible and a zero divisor, as $e(1-e) = 0$, absurd.

### Exercise 7
Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal, and $\pi: A \to A/\mathfrak{p}$ the quotient map. For any $x \in A/\mathfrak{p}$, there is some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x^n = x \iff x(x^{n-1} - 1) = 0$. For any $x \neq 0$, $x^{n-1} = 1$, meaning $x$ is invertible, and $A/\mathfrak{p}$ is a field. 

### Exercise 8
Let $\{\mathfrak{p}_i \mid i \in I \}$ be a totally ordered set of prime ideals. We show that $\mathfrak{q} = \bigcap_i \mathfrak{p}_i$ is still a prime ideal. Indeed, it is an ideal and if $xy \in \mathfrak{q}$, and $x \not\in \mathfrak{q}$, there is a $\mathfrak{p}_i$ such that $x \not\in \mathfrak{p}_i$. It follows that for any $\mathfrak{p}_j$, the possibilities are:
- $y \in \mathfrak{p}_j$ if $\mathfrak{p}_i \subset \mathfrak{p}_j$ 
- Otherwise, $\mathfrak{p}_j \subset \mathfrak{p}_i$ and $x$ or $y$ must be in $\mathfrak{p}_j$, $x$ can't be, so $y \in \mathfrak{p}_j$.
In any case, we conclude that $y \in \mathfrak{q}$. Zorn then applies.

### Exercise 9
If $\mathfrak{a} = r(\mathfrak{a})$ then since $r(\mathfrak{a})$ is the intersection of the prime ideals containing $\mathfrak{a}$, $\mathfrak{a}$ is indeed an intersection of prime ideals.

Now, assume $\mathfrak{a} = \bigcap_i \mathfrak{p}_i$. For any $i$, we have $\mathfrak{a} \subset \mathfrak{p}_i$, meaning $r(\mathfrak{a}) \subset \cap_i \mathfrak{p}_i = \mathfrak{a}$ and the other inclusion always holds, that is $\mathfrak{a} = r(\mathfrak{a})$. 

### Exercise 10
Assume i), we show ii). Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be that prime ideal and let $x$ not be a unit. Then $x$ is contained in some prime ideal, which must be $\mathfrak{p}$. Then $x$ is in the nilradical, that is $x$ is nilpotent.

Assume ii), we show iii). Let $\pi: A \to A/\mathfrak{R}$ be the quotient map. For any $x \in A$, either $x$ is nilpotent and $\pi(x) = 0$ or $x$ is a unit, meaning $\pi(x)$ is invertible. As $\pi$ is surjective, $A/\mathfrak{R}$ is a field.

Assume iii), we show i). Prime ideals of $A$ (containing $\mathfrak{R}$, which is a trivial condition) and prime ideals of $A/\mathfrak{R}$ are in bijective correspondence. Since $A/\mathfrak{R}$ is a field, the only prime ideal of $A$ is $\pi^{-1}(0) = \mathfrak{R}$. 

### Exercise 11
i) Since $2 \in A$, $2 = 2^2 = 4$, meaning $2x = 4x \iff 2x = 0$
ii) Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal. Since $A/\mathfrak{p}$ is integral, $x^2 = x$ gives $x(x-1) = 0$, meaning $x \in \{0; 1\}$. Since $A/\mathfrak{p} \neq 0$, we get $A/\mathfrak{p} \sim \mathbf{F}_2$ 
iii) Let $\mathfrak{q}$ be a finitely generated ideal of $A$, with set of generators $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$. Assume $n > 1$, then $x_1 \neq x_2$. Let $y = x_1 + x_2 + x_1x_2$. Computations give $x_1y = x_1$ and $x_2y = x_2$, that is $\mathfrak{q} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = (y, x_3, \ldots, x_n)$. Iterating this process, we get that $\mathfrak{q}$ is principal.

### Exercise 12
A nontrivial idempotent $e \in A$ gives a nontrivial decomposition $A \simeq A/e \times A/(1-e)$. Indeed, $(e)$ and $(1-e)$ are coprime ideals and CRT applies. A maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $A/e$ gives a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m} \times A/(1-e)$ of $A$, and symetrically. This gives atleast two distinct maximal ideals, as the decomposition is nontrivial.

### Exercise 13
Let $K$ be a field, $\Sigma$ the set of all its irreducible polynomials and $A$ be the polynomial ring $K[x_f \mid f \in \Sigma]$. Let $\mathfrak{a} = (f(x_f))_{f \in \Sigma}$.
For any $p \in \mathfrak{a}$, $p = \sum_{f \in \Sigma}{g_f f(x_f)}$ with finitely many $g_f \in A$ being non-zero. Setting each of these $x_f$ to be a root of $f$ in a finite extension of $K$ gives that $p \neq 1$, and as $p$ is arbitrary, $\mathfrak{a} = (1)$. 
We now let $\mathfrak{m}$ be a maximal ideal containing $\mathfrak{a}$ and $K_1 = A/\mathfrak{m}$. Repeating the construction, we get some increasing sequence of fields $K_1, K_2, \ldots$ and let $L = \bigcup_{n = 1}^{\infty} K_n$.
The fact that any $f \in \Sigma$ of degree $n+1$ splits in $K_n$ is clear by induction, and it follows that any $f \in \Sigma$ splits in $L$. Let $\overline{K}$ be the subset of $L$ of algebraic elements over $K$.  Any finite extension $F/\overline{K}$ is in $L$, as if $f \in \overline{K}[X]$ we must have $f \in K_n[X]$ for $n$ large enough. Since $F$ is a subset of $L$ algebraic over $K$, it follows that $F = \overline{K}$ and $\overline{K}$ is algebraically closed.

### Exercise 14
Wrong proof: See [here]([https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1859329/atiyah-macdonald-exercise-14-chapter-1](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1859329/atiyah-macdonald-exercise-14-chapter-1 "https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1859329/atiyah-macdonald-exercise-14-chapter-1"))

Correct proof:
Increasing union of ideals is an ideal, so Zorn applies. 
Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be a maximal ideal in $\Sigma$ and $xy \in \mathfrak{a}$. We have $(\mathfrak{a}, x)(\mathfrak{a}, y) \subset (\mathfrak{a}, xy) = \mathfrak{a}$. By maximality, if $x, y \not\in \mathfrak{a}$, there is a non-zerodivisor in $(\mathfrak{a}, x)$ and $(\mathfrak{a}, y)$. Product of non-zerodivisor is not a zerodivisor, absurd.

### Exercise 15
i) $V(E) = V(\mathfrak{a})$ is clear, as is $V(\mathfrak{a}) = V(r(\mathfrak{a})$
ii) Same
iii) Same 
iv) The inclusion $\mathfrak{a}\mathfrak{b} \subset \mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}$, gives $V(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}) \subset V(\mathfrak{a}\mathfrak{b})$ Now let $\mathfrak{ab}\subset \mathfrak{p}$ be a prime. For any $x \in \mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}$, $x^2 \in \mathfrak{ab} \subset \mathfrak{p}$ giving $x \in \mathfrak{p}$, and the reverse inclusion.
For any prime $\mathfrak{p}$,$\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b} \subset \mathfrak{p}$  implies $\mathfrak{a} \subset \mathfrak{p}$ or $\mathfrak{b} \subset \mathfrak{p}$, meaning $V(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}) \subset V(\mathfrak{a}) \cup  V(\mathfrak{b})$. The other inclusion is clear.

### Exercise 16
- $Spec(\mathbf{Z})$ is $\{0\}$ and the set of positive primes  $\mathbf{P}$  
- $Spec(\mathbf{R})$ is a single point $0$.
- Nonzero prime ideals of $\mathbf{C}[X]$ are in correspondence with irreductible monic polynomials over $\mathbf{C}$, that is of the form $(X-z), z \in \mathbf{C}$.
- Same thing except that we add polynomials of the form $x^2 + ax + b$ with $a^2 - 4b < 0$ 
- Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal of $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ and let $(p) = \mathfrak{p} \cap \mathbb{Z}$. As any retract of a prime ideal is prime, $p$ must be a prime or $0$.  
If $p = 0$, let $f \in \mathfrak{p}$ of minimal degree, $f$ must be irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, and we write $f = \alpha f'$ with $f'$ irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}$  and $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}^*$ by Gauss' lemma. Since $\alpha \not\in \mathfrak{p}$, $f' \in \mathfrak{p}$ and $\mathfrak{p} = (f')$.
Otherwise, $\mathfrak{p}$ induces a prime ideal of $\mathbf{F}_p[X]$ through a quotient by $(p)$ and it must be of the form $(f)$ with $f$ irreducible over $\mathbf{F}_p$, that is $\mathfrak{p}= (p, f)$.
### Exercise 17
We have the equality $V(\mathfrak{a}) = \bigcap_{a \in \mathfrak{a}}V(a)$ by exercise 15. It follows that the $X_a = X \setminus V(a)$ form a basis of open sets.

i) Exercise 15 gives $V(a) \cup V(b) = V(ab)$ giving $X_a \cap X_b = X_{ab}$
ii) $X_f = \varnothing$ means $f$ is in every prime ideal, i.e $f$ is in the nilradical, so $f$ is nilpotent
iii) $X_f = X$ means that it is in no prime ideal. By Krull's theorem, $(f) = A$ and $f$ is a unit
iv) $X_f = X_g$ means that $f \in \mathfrak{p} \iff g \in \mathfrak{p}$ for any prime $\mathfrak{p}$. It follows that intersecting over that property $r((f)) = r((g))$.
v) It is enough to consider a covering given by the basis of open sets: $X = \bigcup_{i \in I} X_{x_i}$. This equality gives $\bigcap_{i \in I} V((x_i)) = V((x_i)_{i \in I}) = \varnothing$, i.e $(x_i)_{i \in I} = (1)$, and there is a finite subset generating $1$, giving a finite subcover.
vi) This time, a covering may be reduced to something of the form $X_f \subset \bigcup_{i \in I} X_{x_i}$. It implies $V((x_i)_{i \in I}) \subset V(f)$, and thus $f \in r((x_i)_{i \in I})$, meaning there is some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f^n \in ((x_i)_{i \in I})$, and there is finitely many $x_i$'s generating $f^n$. Then $f^n$ is in any prime ideal containing all these $x_i$, and thus $f$ by primality.
vii) If $U$ is a finite union of $X_f$, since a finite union of quasi-compact spaces is still quasi-compact, $U$ is quasi-compact. Now assume $U$ is quasi-compact and consider the family of open sets given by the set of all $X_f$ such that $X_f \subset U$. As the $X_f$ are a basis, this is an open-cover. The result follows.

### Exercise 18
i) If $\{x\}$ is closed means there is some ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ such that $\{x\}= V(\mathfrak{a})$. We must have $\mathfrak{p}_x = \mathfrak{a}$, and if $\mathfrak{p}_x$ is not maximal then any larger ideal containing it contradicts the equality.

Reciprocally if $\mathfrak{p}_x$ is maximal, $V(\mathfrak{p}_x) = \{x\}$.

ii) Let $V(\mathfrak{a})$ be any closed set containing $\mathfrak{p}_x$.  As $\mathfrak{p}_x \in V(\mathfrak{a})$, we must have $V(\mathfrak{p}_x) \subset V(\mathfrak{a})$.

iii) We just showed that $y \in \overline{\{x\}} \iff y \in V(\mathfrak{p}_x)$, which in turn gives $\mathfrak{p}_x \subset \mathfrak{p}_y$ by definition.

iv) Let $x \neq y$, and assume $y \in \overline{\{x\}}$, as otherwise we are done. Then by iii), $\mathfrak{p}_x \subsetneq \mathfrak{p}_y$ and $x \in X\setminus\overline{\{x\}}$.

### Exercise 19
Let's denote by $\mathfrak{n}$ the nilradical. 

Assume $\mathfrak{n}$ is prime, we show $X$ is irreducible. It is enough to show that basic open set intersect. By hypothesis $\mathfrak{n} \in X$,  and for basic open sets $X_f, X_g \neq \varnothing$, we must have $f, g \not\in \mathfrak{n}$, that is $\mathfrak{n} \in X_f \cap X_g$

Now assume $X$ is irreducible and let $X_f, X_g$ be non-empty basic open sets (that is $f, g \not\in \mathfrak{n}$). Since $X_f \cap X_g = X_{fg} \neq \varnothing$, we get $fg \not\in \mathfrak{n}$.
