These are some notes on commutative algebra I took. The LaTeX-ed pdf files are far from optimally typeset as their are built from obsidian-markdown files using Pandoc.

To read the file as proper pdf, please open them from the links below and click on the download button on the top-right corner of the GitHub preview.

 
## Summary

- [Solutions](https://github.com/Shika-B/Commutative-Algebra-Notes/blob/main/Atiyah-McDonald%20Exercices%20(Chapter%201).pdf) to some exercises of the first chapter of Atiyah-Mcdonald.
- [PIDs are Noetherian](https://github.com/Shika-B/Commutative-Algebra-Notes/blob/main/PIDs%20are%20Noetherian.pdf)
- [Dimension of a free module is well-defined](https://github.com/Shika-B/Commutative-Algebra-Notes/blob/main/Dimension%20of%20a%20free%20module.pdf)
- [Smith reduction over a PID](https://github.com/Shika-B/Commutative-Algebra-Notes/blob/main/Smith%20reduction%20over%20a%20PID.pdf)
- Using Smith Normal Form, we prove the [structure theorem of finitely generated modules over a PID](https://github.com/Shika-B/Commutative-Algebra-Notes/blob/main/Structure%20theorem%20of%20finitely%20generated%20modules%20over%20a%20PID.pdf) and use it to get the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups and Frobenius reduction for free
